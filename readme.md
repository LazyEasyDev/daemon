# daemon-util

Install an ordinary executable as a native service on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD,
or Windows. Each application is registered as an independent service and is
managed with the operating system's service manager.

## Quick start

### 1. Build daemon-util

```sh
./build.sh
```

Choose the binary in `build/` that matches the target system:

| System | Architectures | Binary pattern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | AMD64, 386, ARM64, ARM32 | `daemon-linux-*` |
| macOS | Intel, Apple Silicon | `daemon-darwin-*` |
| FreeBSD | AMD64, ARM64 | `daemon-freebsd-*` |
| Windows | AMD64, 386, ARM64 | `daemon-windows-*.exe` |

You can rename the selected binary to `daemon` or `daemon.exe`.

### 2. Put the files in a trusted location

A simple layout is:

```text
/opt/myservice/
├── daemon
├── myapp
└── config.toml
```

Linux and FreeBSD services run as `root`; Windows services run as
`LocalSystem`. Keep the daemon binary, application, scripts, and their parent
directories writable only by trusted administrators. Otherwise, another user
could replace code that the service manager executes with elevated privileges.

### 3. Install the service

Linux or FreeBSD:

```sh
cd /opt/myservice
sudo ./daemon install myservice myapp --config config.toml
```

macOS installs a service for the current user. Do not use `sudo`:

```sh
cd /Applications/MyService
./daemon install myservice myapp --config config.toml
```

Windows requires PowerShell or Command Prompt opened with **Run as
administrator**:

```powershell
cd C:\ProgramData\MyService
.\daemon.exe install myservice .\myapp.exe --config config.toml
```

`myservice` is the service name. Everything after the application path is
passed unchanged to the application.

### 4. Manage the service

Use `sudo` for these commands on Linux and FreeBSD. Do not use `sudo` on
macOS. Continue using an administrator terminal on Windows.

```sh
./daemon start myservice
./daemon status myservice
./daemon restart myservice
./daemon stop myservice
./daemon remove myservice
```

List every service installed by this tool:

```sh
./daemon list
# Short form:
./daemon ls
```

Show the application arguments recorded during installation:

```sh
./daemon list -l
# Short form:
./daemon ls -l
```

The arguments are displayed as received by daemon-util, joined with spaces.

Example output:

```text
NAME       STATUS   APP
api        stopped  /opt/api/api
myservice  running  /opt/myservice/myapp
```

## Command reference

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `install <name> <application> [arguments...]` | Register an application as a service |
| `list` or `ls` (`-l`, `--long`) | List services; long output includes application arguments |
| `start <name>` | Start a service |
| `stop <name>` | Stop a service |
| `restart <name>` | Stop and start a service |
| `status <name>` | Show a service's current state |
| `remove <name>` or `delete <name>` | Stop and unregister a service |

Service names must:

- start with an ASCII letter;
- contain only ASCII letters and digits;
- be no longer than 241 characters.

## Install options

### Warning confirmation

When daemon-util detects a potentially unsafe installation, it displays the
warning and asks for confirmation in an interactive terminal. Noninteractive
installation stops instead of waiting for input. To skip installation warnings
and their confirmation prompts, place `--ignore-warnings` before the service
name:

```sh
./daemon install --ignore-warnings myservice myapp
```

On Linux, the current warning detects common risky paths and SELinux file
contexts while SELinux is enforcing. This is an advisory heuristic; custom
SELinux policy can permit or deny executable types differently.

### Stop timeout

Set the maximum graceful shutdown time during installation:

```sh
./daemon install --stop-timeout 45s myservice myapp
```

The default is `600s`. The value must be a positive, whole-second Go duration,
such as `45s`, `5m`, or `1h30m`. Place the option before the service name and
application because everything after the application is treated as an
application argument.

When the timeout expires, supported service managers force termination. On
Windows, the value also configures the SCM preshutdown allowance.

When `stop`, `restart`, or `remove` waits longer than one second in an
interactive terminal, daemon-util displays the elapsed stop time and the
configured timeout as an approximate wait, for example:

```text
Stopping myservice... 15s elapsed (within time limit: 45s)
```

The transient progress line is not written when output is redirected. If the
optional metadata is missing, unreadable, or malformed, the command displays
only the elapsed time.

### Application arguments

Arguments are preserved, including spaces and shell characters:

```sh
./daemon install myservice myapp \
  --port 8080 \
  --config "configs/production config.toml"
```

The application must remain in the foreground for its entire lifetime. It
must not fork into the background or daemonize itself.

## Executable paths

A relative application path is resolved beside the daemon-util binary, not
from the shell's current directory. Use an absolute path when the application
is stored elsewhere:

```sh
sudo ./daemon install myservice "/opt/My Service/myapp"
```

During installation, daemon-util:

1. converts the application path to an absolute path;
2. resolves symbolic links;
3. verifies that the target is a native executable;
4. registers the resolved path with the service manager.

Changing the original symbolic link later does not change the installed
service. Reinstall the service to use a different executable path.

The application's initial working directory is the directory containing its
resolved executable. Relative application arguments, such as configuration
paths, are resolved from there unless the application changes directories.

On Linux systems using systemd, executable paths containing dollar signs,
single quotes, double quotes, backslashes, control characters, or a parent
directory ending with a space are rejected during installation. Move the
executable to a conventional path before installing it. This restriction does
not apply to application arguments.

### Running scripts

Install the native interpreter and pass the script as its first argument:

```sh
sudo ./daemon install myservice /bin/sh /opt/myservice/service.sh
```

On macOS, use the same command without `sudo`.

## Platform behavior

| Platform | Service manager | Installation scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | systemd, OpenRC, OpenWrt procd, Upstart, System V, or Buildroot init | System-wide |
| macOS | launchd | Current user |
| FreeBSD | rc.d with `/usr/sbin/daemon` | System-wide |
| Windows | Service Control Manager | System-wide, LocalSystem |

Restart policy and shutdown behavior follow the selected native service
manager, so small behavioral differences between platforms are expected.

### Process cleanup

| Backend | Descendant handling when stopped |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | Sends `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT`, then terminates the Job Object after the timeout |
| systemd | Stops processes remaining in the service control group |
| OpenRC | Stops the supervised process group |
| System V | Starts a dedicated session and signals its process group |
| macOS launchd | Uses launchd's default process-group cleanup |
| Buildroot, Upstart, OpenWrt, FreeBSD | Relies on native service-manager or supervisor behavior |

Applications must not deliberately escape supervision by creating a separate
session, process group, or console.

### Windows applications

Applications do not need to implement the Windows SCM protocol. daemon-util
runs a separate wrapper process for each service and hosts the application as
a console program.

For graceful shutdown, the application must handle `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT`. Go
applications receive it as `os.Interrupt` through `os/signal`. GUI applications
and descendants that create a separate console or process group are not
supported. A nonzero application exit activates the configured SCM recovery
actions.

### Service list metadata

The `APP` column and the `ARGS` column shown by `list -l` are informational.
daemon-util stores the resolved application path and the application arguments
in the platform's application-data directory, but this metadata does not
control the service. Installation and listing still work if metadata cannot be
written or read; the values will be blank. Removal deletes metadata on a
best-effort basis.

## Testing

Run the unit tests:

```sh
go test ./...
```

Build the configurable HTTP test application:

```sh
./test_app/build.sh
```

The binaries are written to `test_app/build/`. For example:

```sh
sudo ./daemon install apptest /absolute/path/to/test_app/build/test-app-linux-amd64 \
  --port 18080
sudo ./daemon start apptest
curl http://127.0.0.1:18080/healthz
```

See [test_app/README.md](test_app/README.md) for argument, restart, and graceful
shutdown test scenarios.

## Architecture

### Runtime model

daemon-util is a management CLI, not a permanently running shared supervisor.
An install operation follows this flow:

```text
User command
  │
  ▼
daemon-util
  ├── validates the service name and executable
  ├── resolves the executable to an absolute path
  ├── selects the platform backend
  ├── writes or registers the native service definition
  └── stores informational list metadata
       │
       ▼
  Native service manager
       │
       ▼
    Application process
```

After registration, daemon-util exits. The native service manager owns boot
startup, process monitoring, restart policy, status, and shutdown. Later
`start`, `stop`, `restart`, `status`, and `remove` commands communicate with
that service manager instead of controlling a long-running daemon-util
process.

Windows is the only platform that needs an additional runtime component. Each
installed service starts its own daemon-util wrapper because ordinary console
applications do not implement the Windows SCM protocol. The wrapper belongs
to that service only; it is not shared with other installed applications.

### Backend selection

Platform-specific Go files are selected at build time. Linux then detects the
available init system at runtime in this order:

1. systemd;
2. OpenRC;
3. Upstart;
4. OpenWrt procd;
5. Buildroot-style init;
6. System V as the fallback when `/etc/init.d` exists.

Installation creates the native definition expected by the selected backend:

| Backend | Registered definition |
| --- | --- |
| systemd | `/etc/systemd/system/<name>.service` |
| OpenRC, OpenWrt, System V | `/etc/init.d/<name>` |
| Upstart | `/etc/init/<name>.conf` |
| Buildroot | `/etc/init.d/S90<name>` |
| FreeBSD rc.d | `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/<name>` |
| macOS launchd | `~/Library/LaunchAgents/<name>.plist` |
| Windows SCM | Service Control Manager database entry |

Internally, daemon-util prefixes registration names so `list` can distinguish
services created by this tool from unrelated system services. Commands and
output continue to use the original user-facing name.

### Service isolation

Each installed application has its own native service definition and process
supervision. One failing application therefore does not take daemon-util or
other managed applications down with it.

A single shared supervisor was intentionally avoided because it would:

- create one failure point for every managed application;
- require safely adopting surviving processes after a supervisor restart;
- duplicate native restart, shutdown, boot, dependency, and permission logic;
- keep an additional privileged control process running permanently.

This design favors native reliability and failure isolation over identical
behavior on every platform. Exact restart and shutdown semantics follow the
capabilities of the selected service manager.

### Configuration and metadata

The native service definition is authoritative. It contains the resolved
executable path, application arguments, working directory, restart behavior,
and stop timeout supported by that backend.

daemon-util also keeps a small metadata file containing the application path
shown by `list` and the stop timeout used for the terminal's approximate wait.
Metadata writes are best-effort and deliberately non-authoritative: failure,
deletion, or damage does not affect installation or service operation. Native
service-manager tools can continue to manage the service without daemon-util.
